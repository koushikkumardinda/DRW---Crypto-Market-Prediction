# DRW---Crypto-Market-Prediction

This repository hosts a project focused on predicting cryptocurrency market movements. Leveraging historical data from major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, we've developed a robust machine learning model to forecast price trends for a variety of digital assets. The primary goal is to provide a predictive tool that can assist traders and researchers in understanding market volatility.

Key Features 
Data Aggregation: Automated scripts pull and clean historical price data, including OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) values and trading volume.

Feature Engineering: The project incorporates technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD as predictive features.

Model Architecture: We use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is particularly effective for time-series forecasting due to its ability to recognize patterns in sequential data.

Interactive Visualization: A user-friendly dashboard (built with Streamlit) allows for real-time model predictions and visualization of forecast trends against actual data.
